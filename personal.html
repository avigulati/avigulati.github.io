<center>My birthday is September 19th, meaning that at the time of this writing, I am currently 15 years old. I am the youngest in my family with only one sibling, an older brother. Arik is 17 years old and also attends Dalton, which is nice because I get to see and interact with him throughout the day. I have a great relationship with him, for he can sometimes serve as my best friend, but also as a guardian who protects and helps me. Both of us were born in New York City and have been residents ever since, unlike my parents. My mother was born and raised in India, with both her parents being professors along with her dad also being a part of the police force. He recently retired after 30 years of working stepping down from the position of Chief of the department.  Likewise, my father was also born in India, but relocated to Switzerland at the age of 4 due to his parents’ professions. As scientists, they were drawn to Switzerland and have lived there ever since. My dad grew up in the French speaking part of Switzerland, meaning he is bilingual. My dad went to Wharton at the age of 17, and finished college in 2 years. He returned to India for work where he met my mother, and after meeting each other, my mom pursed her academics at Columbia business school and later worked as a banker. He later went on to be a very successful investor. Because of my dad’s childhood, I consider myself part Swiss, along with Indian, for that is both of my parents birthplace, and obviously American.
