	A crucial component to my character is my social life, meaning whenever I have free time, I make an effort to hangout with my friends, strengthening my relationships as well as expanding my social network. During weekdays, most of my socialization happens on the soccer pitch, for I am not left with much free time after practices or games. If I manage to finish a substantial	 portion of my work for the night, I usually go to dinner with a couple friends before returning home for the night. Although academics take priority in my life, my social life is the primary focus during the weekends. It is vital to put effort and time into academics, but in order to be successful, I believe that it is even more important to have a good balance between the academic and social aspects of a person. I try to spend most of the day out of my house, walking around with friends or going to one of their houses. If it is not possible to meet with friends in person, I spend my free time on FaceTime with them, although in person interactions are much more meaningful and enjoyable. I strongly value my relationships with my friends, for they have shaped much of my character and personality, and I am proud to have surrounded myself with such great people.
