<div>So far in CS1, we have explored using html within sublime text, and how to code in general. Through the course of the class up to this point, I have learned and now understand the basics surrounding coding within sublime text using html. I am comfortable with the material that we have learned, and am happy with the fact that I understand most of what I am doing. Although I may not be able to completely recreate a code, I am confidently able to explain what every aspect of the code affects. Currently I am working on construction and arranging the website, specifically the homepage to it.</div>

This week I focused primarily on my about me page, as well as making sure the images on the linked divs worked. For the about me page, I wanted to make separate sections for the different aspects of my life. It was not too challenging to make them, for it was almost copying and pasting from the original index homepage. The only thing that I found frustrating was trying to make the images zoom in, but I realized that the images had to be a jpg.

This week I started my first project, a gift for my mother. So far, I only have a rough draft of what I want to do, but I plan to put a picture of the United States of America, and in different places around the country, I want there to be little clickable squares that link to different national parks. My mom loves hiking and national parks, so I wanted to make a website that would give information on the most popular hiking destinations and national parks. The project seems pretty straightforward so far, the only confusing part is having the divs overlap and their position to be in relation to each other rather than to the size of the whole page. Aside from the project, I am struggling with adding a photo to the about me div on the homepage of my website because it was not found on the internet but rather from my camera roll.
