<div>So far in CS1, we have explored using html within sublime text, and how to code in general. Through the course of the class up to this point, I have learned and now understand the basics surrounding coding within sublime text using html. I am comfortable with the material that we have learned, and am happy with the fact that I understand most of what I am doing. Although I may not be able to completely recreate a code, I am confidently able to explain what every aspect of the code affects. Currently I am working on construction and arranging the website, specifically the homepage to it.</div>

This week I focused primarily on my about me page, as well as making sure the images on the linked divs worked. For the about me page, I wanted to make separate sections for the different aspects of my life. It was not too challenging to make them, for it was almost copying and pasting from the original index homepage. The only thing that I found frustrating was trying to make the images zoom in, but I realized that the images had to be a jpg.

This week I started my first project, a gift for my mother. So far, I only have a rough draft of what I want to do, but I plan to put a picture of the United States of America, and in different places around the country, I want there to be little clickable squares that link to different national parks. My mom loves hiking and national parks, so I wanted to make a website that would give information on the most popular hiking destinations and national parks. The project seems pretty straightforward so far, the only confusing part is having the divs overlap and their position to be in relation to each other rather than to the size of the whole page. Aside from the project, I am struggling with adding a photo to the about me div on the homepage of my website because it was not found on the internet but rather from my camera roll.

This week we learned as a class how to make and use functions within sublime text. In order for a function to be performed, there needs to be a variable. A variable is a word that relates to a set of code that is not already defined in javascript. The function relates to the variable in the sense that the variable is affected/moved based on the function. To make the function actually run, you must restate the function name and put () after the area where you define the function. Some words that I have learned in javascript so far are function, script, interval, document, classList, and appendchild. The function that I created is linked on my projects page, where an image of a cookie is repeatedly produced.

Through reading the article on RGB lighting, I conceived a better concept as for how it works. Pixels on any digital screen are made of RGB lighting, which is how any image is displayed on the screen. By using a combination of the colors red, green, and blue, up to approximately 16 and a half million colors can be displayed. It is important to note that RGB is different from CMYK, which is used for colored printing rather than coloring digital images. Currently in the class I am working on creating a function using java script that prints dinosaurs repeatedly, and when clicked on, an asteroid appears creating the image that the dinosaur was hit by an asteroid.

In class today, we went over a checklist of aspects that should be included on our website, as well as having an understanding of how to perform and create different actions through HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I knew and understood how to make everything required, except I had a misunderstanding of what and how arrays functioned. After reviewing in class, I understand how the array serves almost as a list where other actions pull certain information from the list and print it. My website is now up to date, with several projects including a color randomizer, gift for my mother, and listening functions which print photos of my friends and a different one which prints images of cookies and pumpkins. My about me page is complete for now, displaying several sections about the characteristics of my life. I may in the future add more small features like the soccer ball on the home page.
