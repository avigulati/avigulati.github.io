<center><div id="academictitle">Academic Life</div></center>

<center>I am a student at a private school on the upper east side, and have attended since kindergarten. As a freshman, I am currently taking Biology, Topics in world History, Literature and Composition, algebra 2a and pre-calculus, French, and obviously Computer Science. In previous years, I have been fortunate enough to explore other, more abstract classes, such as zen dance, digital fabrication, chorus, and more. As a part of my school community, I am also enrolled in various clubs, those being The Wildlife club, The Architecture club, and Whiskey Bravo. As a member of the wildlife club, we primarily focus on protecting aquatic life, this year we are specifically focusing on corals. The Architecture club allows for the enhancement of my design and spacial awareness skills, for we work together to build and design various blueprints. Within the Whiskey Bravo club, we are making a strong effort to support both our brave veterans and their families, along with purely demonstrating our respect and admiration for what they have done to protect and serve our country. I am also on various sport teams, which is explained more in depth in the Athletic section. The school hosts a strong community of future leaders and innovators, and I am honored to be apart of the program. </center>
