<center>From the age of 2, I have always involved myself in sports, even when I was too young to make decisions for myself. I have played several different sports through the years, some of which are football, baseball, soccer, tennis, golf, squash, lacrosse, basketball, swimming, archery, table tennis, bowling, and even curling. Soccer has always been my main sport, and I joined a team at the age of 5, playing on super soccer stars and later transferring to west side soccer. At the age of 11, I started playing on both a standard and travel team for soccer, which really advanced	my soccer skills, as well as enlightening me to what role responsibility for others plays. In fourth grade, I joined a basketball team with several of my school friends, and we played with eachother until the global pandemic. While being on this team, I was also a part of a more casual team which would play once a week. Tennis has always been my favorite hobby, and I started hitting when I was 3 with my father. The summer before 6th grade is when I started playing more frequently and hit with a coach. I was scheduled to play in my first tournament in the summer, but due to covid, I was unable to do so. As a part of Dalton, I play on the Junior Varsity soccer team as right back, and in previous years I have been on the basketball A team. As a freshman, tennis is now an option, so I hope to pursue tennis as a part of the Dalton Tennis program. Tying into my social life, it is important for me to take breaks from the rigorous academic studies required by Dalton, and sports are a mechanism of doing so. </center>
